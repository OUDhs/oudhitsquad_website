<blockquote> This is just going to be a quick tutorial on using ADB's push and pull commands. If you don't know what ADB is check <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html"><FONT COLOR="red">HERE.</FONT></a> This guide assumes that you already have adb.exe accessible from cmd on Windows, and in $PATH in linux. But here is the gist of this command.
<p>
<b> adb pull /PATH/TO/FILE/ON/PHONE /PATH/ON/PC/WHERE/YOU/WANT/IT </b>
<p>
and it's counterpart here:
<p>
<b> adb push /PATH/ON/PC /PATH/ON/PHONE </b>
<p>
That is basically it. There are plenty of guides on the internet that will help you out with ADB.
